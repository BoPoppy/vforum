          Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
          paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five
          sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though,
          the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a
          paragraph.
